# 📌 Python Basics & Student Management System

* *🚀 Overview 

This project explores fundamental Python programming concepts, including:

🛠️ Control Flow & Loops (If-Else, For & While loops)

📂 Lists, Tuples & Dictionaries (Data structures for managing information)

🎯 Sets & Frozensets (Handling unique data efficiently)

Additionally, we built a Student Management System, applying these concepts in a real-world scenario. 🏫

📚 Lessons Covered

** 📌 Lesson 05: Control Flow & Loops **

🔹 If-Else Conditions: Making decisions in code.🔹 For Loop: Iterating over a range or collection.🔹 While Loop: Executing tasks based on conditions.

** 📌 Lesson 06: Lists, Tuples & Dictionaries **

📌 Lists: Mutable sequence storing multiple items.📌 Tuples: Immutable sequence for fixed collections.📌 Dictionaries: Key-value pairs for structured data storage.

** 📌 Lesson 07: Sets & Frozensets **

🔹 Set: Unordered collection of unique elements.<br/>
🔹 Frozenset: Immutable set for fixed unique values.


## 🏗️ Project: Student Management System

A simple Python program to manage student records using control flow, loops, dictionaries, and sets.

✨ Features:

✅ Add new students with name, age, and grade.
✅ Display the list of students.
✅ Remove a student by name.
✅ Maintain a unique set of student records.

🎯 ** Key Takeaways ** 

🔹 Python’s control flow allows efficient decision-making.
🔹 Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries provide structured data handling.
🔹 Sets & Frozensets help maintain unique collections.
🔹 Practical implementation through Student Management System.

🚀 Excited to keep learning and building more projects!
